Running the Application
Development Server

To run the application in development mode, use the following command:
```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. The server will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
Building for Production

To create a production build of the application, use the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate the optimized production files in the dist directory.
Previewing the Production Build

To preview the production build locally, use the following command:

```
npm run preview
```

This will serve the contents of the dist directory on a local server, allowing you to test the production build.
Deployment

After building the application, you can deploy the contents of the dist directory to your preferred web hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).
